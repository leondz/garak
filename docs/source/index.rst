Welcome to the garak reference documentation
============================================

**garak** is an LLM vulnerability scanner, `<https://garak.ai>`_.
It uses a huge range of probes to examine and query a large language model, simulating
attacks, and uses a range of detectors on the model's outputs to see if the model was 
vulnerable to any of those attacks.

This is the code reference documentation, mostly useful for developers and people interested
in how garak works. There is a separate `User Guide <https://docs.garak.ai>`_ containing information
on running garak and interpreting results. If you want to use the tool and get results,
and you don't care about its internals, then you want the user guide. Take a look there! `<https://docs.garak.ai>`_

On the other hand, if you'd like a to get into the the details or work out how 
to contribute code, you're in the right place - welcome!
