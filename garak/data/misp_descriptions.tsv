owasp:llm01	LLM01: Prompt Injection	Crafty inputs can manipulate a Large Language Model, causing unintended actions. Direct injections overwrite system prompts, while indirect ones manipulate inputs from external sources.
owasp:llm02	LLM02: Insecure Output Handling	This vulnerability occurs when an LLM output is accepted without scrutiny, exposing backend systems. Misuse may lead to severe consequences like XSS, CSRF, SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.
owasp:llm03	LLM03: Training Data Poisoning	This occurs when LLM training data is tampered, introducing vulnerabilities or biases that compromise security, effectiveness, or ethical behavior. Sources include Common Crawl, WebText, OpenWebText, & books.
owasp:llm04	LLM04: Model Denial of Service	Attackers cause resource-heavy operations on Large Language Models leading to service degradation or high costs. The vulnerability is magnified due to the resource-intensive nature of LLMs and unpredictability of user inputs.
owasp:llm05	LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities	LLM application lifecycle can be compromised by vulnerable components or services, leading to security attacks. Using third-party datasets, pre- trained models, and plugins can add vulnerabilities.
owasp:llm06	LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure	LLMs may reveal confidential data in its responses, leading to unauthorized data access, privacy violations, and security breaches. It’s crucial to implement data sanitization and strict user policies to mitigate this.
owasp:llm07	LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design	LLM plugins can have insecure inputs and insufficient access control. This lack of application control makes them easier to exploit and can result in consequences like remote code execution.
owasp:llm08	LLM08: Excessive Agency	LLM-based systems may undertake actions leading to unintended consequences. The issue arises from excessive functionality, permissions, or autonomy granted to the LLM-based systems.
owasp:llm09	LLM09: Overreliance	Systems or people overly depending on LLMs without oversight may face misinformation, miscommunication, legal issues, and security vulnerabilities due to incorrect or inappropriate content generated by LLMs.
owasp:llm10	LLM10: Model Theft	This involves unauthorized access, copying, or exfiltration of proprietary LLM models. The impact includes economic losses, compromised competitive advantage, and potential access to sensitive information.
