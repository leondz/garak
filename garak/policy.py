Policy metadata
The total set of points in the behaviour typology can be represented as a dictionary. Definitions of policy names, descriptions, and behaviours are stored in a JSON data file

* Key: behaviour identifier - format is TDDDs*
	* T: a top-level hierarchy code letter, in CTMS for chat/tasks/meta/safety
	* D: a three-digit code for this behaviour
	* s*: (optional) one or more letters identifying a sub-policy

* Value: a dict describing a behaviour
    * “name”: A short name of what is permitted when this behaviour is allowed
    * “description”: (optional) a deeper description of this behaviour

The structure of the identifiers describes the hierarchical structure.
Prompts & probes
Example prompts or probes to be used to test a behaviour. Not every entry in the policy needs to have prompts or probes defined, and if a policy does have them define, it doesn’t need to have both described. If a prompt is given, it’s assumed that the mitigation.mitigationBypass detector should be used for this. That detector should always point to our best-effort mitigation message detection.

* Key: behaviour identifier
* Value: a dict describing how to test
	* “prompts”: a list of strings to try to test the behaviour
	* “probes”: garak probes compatible with load_plugin() that can test the behaviour

Implementing policy probes
--------------------------

Probes that are non-adversarial and only test a policy should have a class attr like “policy_probe”

Policy probes, i.e. those where this is set to true, should also list the policies that they test for, in a class var. E.g. if “policies_tested = [“C006”]” then hits in this probe indicate the model’s policy is to permit policy point C006.

Following from this, 

-- list_probes should NOT show policy probes
-- list_policy_probes should list policy probes, and be added to garak.command 
probe_spec expansions need to be able to select between policy and non-policy probes
Propose an optional filter value in plugin enumeration, a dict where values have to be matched for them to be returned

Questions:

* Where do the policy scan results go? Harnesses don't return much -> evaluators return information used to develop results; policy is serialised and written to report jonsl and policy jsonl
* How do we differentiate policy results in the results log? Distinct type tag

Policy expectations / examples
------------------------------

We might like to define an example policy for an LLM. This can be done in JSON.

* Key: behaviour identifier
* Value: True if this is allowed, False if this is not allowed, None if no stance is taken

If leaf behaviours are not included, the parent’s value is assumed to apply, rather than the leaf taking a default like None.

Denoting policy
---------------

Object: `Policy`

Methods: 
```
policy.permitted(behaviour) -> True/False/None
policy.compare(policy) -> list of policy points where there’s a difference
policy.set(prefix, value) -> set prefix to value
policy.settree(prefix, value) -> set this and all sub-points in the policy to value
```

Run flow
--------

1. Start-up
2. If policy scan is enabled..
3. Run a policy test (garak.command)
    a. Select policy probes (add filtering to _plugins.enumerate() ?)
    b. Invoke a policy harness (garak.harnesses.policy)
    6. Process results using a policy evaluator (garak.evaluators.policy ?)
    d. Convert eval result into a policy (garak.policy)
4. Write policy to report jsonl
5. Assemble the main run
    a. (optionally) Skip probes that test things we permit anyway
6. Store policy somewhere transient where can grab it later
