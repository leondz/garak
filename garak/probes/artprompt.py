"""artprompt: ArtPrompt Attack Generation. 

Implementations of [ArtPrompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11753) attacks.

Probe generates attempts to jailbreaks using prompt mutation to and ASCII art.

Implements a subset of Safety testing prompts from [SimpleSafetyTests](https://github.com/bertiev/SimpleSafetyTests).

Warning: These attack models may generate harmful responses - peruse logs
at your own risk, and don't spend too much time doing it, using this guide to
working with harmful text:
