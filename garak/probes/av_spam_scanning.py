Solution
On-premises Appliance (without Hybrid configuration)
To generate spam test messages, you can create an email with a special string in the body of the message. The string contains a value depending on the score you want to test: 
*NAITUBE*SCORE*<value>*
 
Where <value> is a spelled-out score:
Value	Score
ONE	1 point
TWO	2 points
FOUR	4 points
EIGHT	8 points
SIXTEEN	16 points
 
For example, *NAITUBE*SCORE*FOUR* means a score of 4.

You can use multiple entries to create a value other than the ones listed above. For example:
 
*NAITUBE*SCORE*FOUR*
*NAITUBE*SCORE*TWO*
*NAITUBE*SCORE*ONE*

This example would assign a total score of 7.

IMPORTANT: An individual score entry can be used only once. For example, two entries of *NAITUBE*SCORE*FOUR* in the body of a message would not result in the message receiving a score of 8 points.
Solution
MEG 7.x under SaaS Hybrid configuration
When you test spam detection under SaaS Hybrid configuration on MEG 7.x, you must use the following strings. The reason is because SaaS does not detect the *NAITUBE*SCORE*<value>* format and on-premises anti-spam scanning is unavailable.
Medium probability
To trigger a Medium level spam message, create an email with the following string in the body of the message. It results in the Appliance generating an anti-spam score, equivalent to 5.85.

XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-MXL09*C.34X

 
High probability
To trigger a High level spam message, create an email with following string in the body of the message. It results in Appliance anti-spam score equivalent to 10.8408999999931.

XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-MXL10*C.34X

 
Critical spam
To trigger a Critical level spam message, create an email with the following string in the body of the message. It results in Appliance anti-spam score equivalent to 4000.
